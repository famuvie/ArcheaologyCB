- Comparison of approaches

  - leave-one-out cross validation with 95% CI and frequency of observed values within intervals

  - maps of prediction error
    - *Done for India*

- Optional additional approach: MDS transformation of cost-based distances (Murphy et al. 2015)

- Box-Cox transformation of variables? (use profile likelihood to build a CI for \lambda, as in Murphy et al., 2015)
  - For Calcium data at India, lambda_est = 0.82 and the profile likelihood CI includes 1.
  - It doesn't look like a great transform. I don't think it will change much.
  - The (shifted) residuals of the kriging models yield yet larger intervals

- Fix nugget to 0? (i.e. as in Murphy et al., 2015) They argue that this gives better fitting.
  - In the observations of Cu from India, the maximum-likelihood variogram degenerates to variance and range of zero.

- Produce maps with scale and north-arrow
