- Comparison of approaches

  - leave-one-out cross validation with 95% CI and frequency of observed values within intervals

  - maps of prediction error

- Optional additional approach: MDS transformation of cost-based distances (Murphy et al. 2015)

- Box-Cox transformation of variables? (use profile likelihood to build a CI for \lambda, as in Murphy et al., 2015)

- Fix nugget to 0? (i.e. as in Murphy et al., 2015) They argue that this gives better fitting.

- Produce maps with scale and north-arrow
